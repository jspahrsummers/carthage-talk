# Ruthlessly Simple Dependency Management with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a new dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift projects, intended to be the simplest way to add frameworks to a Cocoa application. Carthage works by delegating tasks to Xcode and Git, minimizing new concepts as much as possible, so you can continue to use the tools you’re already familiar with.

This talk will explain what Carthage is and how to use it, then dive into the philosophy of ruthless simplicity that inspired the project. We’ll also compare and contrast Carthage with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), the original dependency manager for Cocoa. Finally, we’ll explore how Carthage is architected under-the-hood, and the benefits we’ve seen from writing it completely in Swift.

_This talk will be given at the [April
2 meeting](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language/events/220485678/) of
[SLUG](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language), using [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com) theme “Sketchnote.”_
